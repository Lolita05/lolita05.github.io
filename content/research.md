      title: Cancer Research
      text: |
        Over the past three years at [BostonGene](https://bostongene.com/), I've been diving deep into cancer research. I began by exploring the connections between the microbiome and tumorsâ€”specifically, how the microbiome influences cancer development. I participated in a project focused on the tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer, and later transitioned to a Liquid Biopsy project that has really pushed the boundaries of precision diagnostics and biomarker discovery.

      title: Magnetotactic Bacteria Research
      text: |
        Since my 3rd year as an undergraduate, I have been immersed in the study of magnetotactic bacteria â€” fascinating microorganisms with a unique internal chain of magnetosome crystals. Their intriguing structure and potential impact on the biotechnology industry have always captivated my curiosity.
        Check out these remarkable organisms:

        I dedicated my entire undergraduate and masterâ€™s studies to understanding these organisms, and I truly enjoyed every step of this journey.

      title: Microbiome in Soils Research
      text: |
        During my second and third years, I worked at the Eco-physiology of Microorganisms Laboratory [(link)](https://soil.msu.ru/kafedry/kaf-biologia/biologia-issledovania/1898-hydrolytic-microorganism) at MSU under the guidance of [Prof. Manucharova N.A.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Natalia-Manucharova)
        I focused on exploring the rich microbial life in soils, learning how these communities drive essential ecosystem functions.
