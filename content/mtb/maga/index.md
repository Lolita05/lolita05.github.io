In my master’s research, we found that the diversity of magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) goes far beyond the well-known phyla. Early hints from previous studies were confirmed by my bachelor’s work, and with the help of a new primer system, we uncovered previously unknown clones that didn’t fit into established groups.

We also integrated metagenomic data into the study, broadening the scope of our findings.

### My contribution:

- Collected samples and purified MTB cells using the MTB-CoSe method.
- Conducted 16S and MamK sequencing to reveal their genetic makeup.
- Searched for 16S sequences in metagenomic data and performed phylogenetic analysis.
- Identified novel MTB groups using metagenomic analysis, marking the first detection of magnetotactic bacteria among the phyla Ca. Firestonebacteria, Ca. Hydrogenedentes, and Elusimicrobia.

This work led to the discovery of two new species: Candidatus Obscuribacterium magneticum and Candidatus Liberimonas magnetica.
