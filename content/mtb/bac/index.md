Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are an intriguing group of prokaryotes that span various taxonomic groups—including several classes of *Proteobacteria*, *Nitrospirae*, and the candidate phylum *Omnitrophica*—with recent metagenomic advances even revealing their presence in *Planctomycetes* and *Ca.* Latescibacteria. These organisms are renowned for synthesizing magnetosomes—unique, iron-based organelles encased in a lipoprotein membrane. However, this trait complicates their detection via traditional *16S rRNA* gene analysis, as magnetosome formation is not restricted to a single lineage and MTB are often present in very low numbers.

To overcome these challenges, my thesis focused on developing a universal primer system that targets functional genes involved in magnetosome biomineralization. This innovative approach aimed to unmask the hidden diversity of MTB in soil microbial communities—a pursuit I found both innovative and immensely rewarding.

### My contribution:
- Created a database of known magnetosome biomineralization island genes from GenBank to identify the ideal marker gene.
- Selected the *mamK* gene as the target for primer design.
- Designed eight primer systems.
- Tested these primer systems with PCR, optimized conditions, and selected the best performing system.
- Validated the system on pure cultures and microbial communities, comparing the results with TEM and light microscopy observations.

This work led to the discovery of two new species: *Candidatus* Obscuribacterium magneticum and *Candidatus* Liberimonas magnetica.
