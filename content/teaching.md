      subtitle: Experience
      text: |
        Teaching has always been a passion of mine—it’s where I get to combine my love for science with the joy of sharing knowledge. Since my university days, I’ve been drawn to helping others understand complex ideas in clear and engaging ways. I believe that teaching is not only about imparting knowledge but also about inspiring curiosity and fostering growth, both for my students and for myself.
