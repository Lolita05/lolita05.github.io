Oil spills and soil contamination are significant challenges, and finding new bioremediation strategies is essential. Our lab focused on identifying oil-degrading bacteria that could be used in soil cleanup, an area that is increasingly important in regions with growing oil extraction in colder climates.

My coursework project examined how temperature affects the metabolic activity of soil microbiomes in oil-contaminated environments. I explored three temperature conditions:  

4¬∞C ‚Äì Representative of northern soils  
28¬∞C ‚Äì The optimal temperature for microbial growth  
46¬∞C ‚Äì Reflective of southern soils  

As a result:
- Oil-contaminated samples showed increased CO‚ÇÇ emissions and greater accumulation of metabolically active prokaryotic biomass compared to controls.
- The highest microbial activity was observed at 28¬∞C in both experimental and control samples.
- Several promising oil-degrading bacterial phyla were identified.

### My contributions:
- Designed an experiment to initiate microbial succession.
- Measured CO‚ÇÇ emissions using gas chromatography to monitor metabolic activity.
- Quantified metabolically active prokaryotes using the FISH method.
- Extracted DNA for next-generation sequencing to further analyze the microbial community.
- Conducted comprehensive taxonomic analyses.

üèÜ This project, which I thoroughly enjoyed working on, was recognized with an additional scholarship award for the Best Coursework Project.
