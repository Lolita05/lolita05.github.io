At BostonGene, I contributed to a project investigating the complex interplay between the microbiome and cancer development, with a particular focus on colorectal and pancreatic cancers. We explored how the microbiome can influence cancer progression, potentially driving both beneficial and adverse outcomes.

Using a combination of public datasets—such as TCGA, CPTAC, and other cohorts—and proprietary data from our collaborators, our analyses revealed striking findings. Notably, when comparing worst prognosis samples (WPS) to better prognosis samples (BPS), we identified a distinct microbiome signature that was inversely correlated with alpha diversity. For instance, the WPS group showed enrichment of genera such as Acinetobacter, Escherichia, and Polynucleobacter.

### My contributions:

- **Tool Integration:** Integrated and optimized the PathSeq tool to detect bacterial transcripts in patient RNA-seq data, seamlessly incorporating it into our broader RNA-seq analysis pipeline.
- **Comprehensive Analysis:** Conducted in-depth microbiome analyses on over 1,000 colorectal and pancreatic cancer cases using datasets from TCGA, CPTAC, and proprietary sources.
- **Biomarker Discovery:** Identified key correlations between patient survival, gene expression profiles, and specific bacterial genera, contributing to the development of novel prognostic biomarkers that could inform future cancer diagnostics and therapeutic strategies.
