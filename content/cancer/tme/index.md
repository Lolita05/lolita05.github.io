The intricate tumor microenvironment (TME) of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has long hindered the development of reliable predictive biomarkers for targeted therapies and immunomodulatory strategies. A comprehensive understanding of the TME is essential for advancing precision therapeutics in PDAC.

In our study, we harnessed transcriptomic data to decode the TME in PDAC. Using a panel of 25 functional gene signatures, we performed unsupervised clustering on data from over 1,600 patients, revealing four distinct TME subtypes. We validated these findings in an independent cohort by correlating each subtype with clinical outcomes and treatment responses. This approach deepened our understanding of cellular interactions within pancreatic tumors and laid the groundwork for more tailored immunotherapy strategies.

### My Contributions:

- Prepared and processed a private RNA-seq cohort.
- Conducted comparative analyses of TME subtypes between short-term and long-term survivors.
