This project aims to create a DEMO atlas of lung tissue using integrated single-cell RNA-seq data from public datasets associated with COPD. It will perform differential expression analysis to identify distinct cell populations and use correlation-based methods to construct a preliminary gene regulatory network (GRN) to pinpoint key regulatory genes driving disease-related cellular differences.
